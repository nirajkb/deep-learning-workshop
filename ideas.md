*  Re-check TensorFlow memory usage fror VGG16 / Inception3(or4), since TensorFlow seems to be in higher demand, frankly
   *  Just a moment, VGG seems like the largest model, but isn't the earliest nor the latest ... Timeline :

*  [WaveNet: A Generative Model for Raw Audio](https://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio/)
   *  Except that (according to Keras implementation), for 1 second of audio, using a downsized model (4000hz vs 16000 sampling rate, 16 filters v/s 256, 2 stacks vs ??):
      *  A Tesla K80 needs around ~4 minutes.
      *  A recent macbook pro needs around ~15 minutes. 
   *  Deepmind has reported that generating one second of audio with their model takes about 90 minutes.

*  [Neural Photo Editor](https://github.com/ajbrock/Neural-Photo-Editor)  
   *  Updated to work through a notebook?  - except that that's mainly a Javascript exercise, with little DL content

*  Investigate the real-ness of :
   *  [PCANet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.3606v2); and 
   *  [SARM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04062v1) :: Ohh, there's already a retraction : (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.04062v2.pdf)
      *  In all, while it is all possible to construct a SARM-VGG model in hours, by choosing all subsets randomly, the performance will not be guaranteed. 
      *  The current implementation for SARM-VGG will bring in dramatically higher complexity and can take multiple days.
      *  Reddit comment : 
         *   Yes, but the part about sparse coding being the fixed point of that particular recurrent neural network defined in terms of the dictionary matrix provides a theoretical motivation for using K-SVD to learn the weights even in the "aggressive approximation".
         *   I found that part of the paper interesting. The confusing part was that in the main experiment on ImageNet they did not seem to use sparse coding at all, they instead seemed to use convolutional PCA or LDA, although that part was difficult to parse.

*  [Cocktail party problem](https://indico.io/blog/biased-debrief-of-the-boston-deep-learning-conference/)
  *  Signal processing problem where multiple speech signals are mixed in a single channel, 
     and the challenge is to separate the individual components (i.e., speakers) from the mix. 
  *  John Hershey from Mitsubishi Electric Research Labs talked through their solution using embedding vectors, then played samples that sounded really good! 
  *  Speech is just one of many kinds of noisy sequence, and it could be fun to explore other signal separation problems using a similar method. 

*  Andrew McCallum: structured knowledge graphs + neural networks
  *  Prof. McCallum was instrumental in developing conditional random fields. 
  *  He talked about a universal schema using structured knowledge bases, a neat take on helping models exploit "what is known" about the world to make better predictions. 
  *  He also talked about traversing graph structures as a sequence, and feeding that to sequence models like LSTM/recurrent neural networks—a known tactic that probably doesn’t get enough attention given the amount of knowledge locked in knowledge graphs.

   *  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12260853

*  Natural Language Processing
   *  Character-wise RNN that's already included is very slow to converge
   *  Probably limited by size of dictionary / corpus for learning
   
   *  Idea : Dual RNNs for NER (which I know 'cold')
      *   219554  818268 3281528 /home/andrewsm/SEER/external/CoNLL2003/ner/eng.train  == pretty small CoNLL training set
          *   BUT : The text for CoNLL-2003 isn't open source (needs Reuters agreement) - so that is out
          
      *   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nltk/nltk_data/gh-pages/packages/models/word2vec_sample.zip  50Mb
      
      *   Instead : Let's install spacy (and shout out to honnibal) and a 'bunch of text' for it to annotate
          *   Except : that's 500Mb of data...  
          *   Perhaps just use its POS (in NLTK) : 
              *   ```pip install nltk  # from nltk.tag.perceptron import PerceptronTagger```
      *   And an [English language](http://corpora2.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/download.html) : 
          *   ```wget http://corpora2.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/downloads/eng_wikipedia_2007_100K-text.tar.gz```
          *   ```wget http://corpora2.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/downloads/eng_wikipedia_2010_100K-text.tar.gz```
          *   ```wget http://corpora2.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/downloads/eng_news_2015_100K.tar.gz```
      *   ```nltk.tokenize.punkt```

      *   Main thing to learn : NER (i.e. NNP) for single-case text


   *  Idea : How about a character-wise name recognition (by region)?
      *  Initial step would be a character-embedding (?Char2Vec)
      *  Then an LSTM ending with a 1-hot region guess :
         *  { China, India, Thailand, Malaysia, Japanese, Philippines, "European" }
      *  This would (a) be useful for NER, (b) kind of fun, and (c) require far less data that a full langauge model
      *  Potential References : 
         *  http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/groups/speech/0100729.pdf
            *   N-grams give about 73% accuracy
            *   ~Syllables give about 74% accuracy
            *   Ensemble is about 78% accuracy
         *  http://lrec.elra.info/proceedings/lrec2010/pdf/763_Paper.pdf
            *   Higher N-gram scores possible (MaxEnt-categorisation)
            *   Our name corpus is built on top of the following two major sources: 
                1) the LDC bilingual person name list and 
                2) the "Person nach Staat" (Person according to state) category of Wikipedia, which contains person names written in English texts from different countries.
                
   *  How about learning to generate names?  e.g : Adversarial RNNs
      *   https://archive.org/details/india-names-dataset
          *   ```grep '^1994' ap-names.txt | sort -k2,2nr | head -50```
          
   *  How about learning to generate English dictionary words?  e.g : Adversarial RNNs
      *   More traditional corpus to vocabulary (with counts, pre-sorted) :
          *   ```andrewsm@holland:/mnt/data/home/andrewsm/OpenSource/Levy/1-billion-sgns/counts.words.vocab```
          *   ```rsync -avz andrewsm@holland:/mnt/data/home/andrewsm/OpenSource/billion-placeholder/data/2-glove/ALL_1-vocab.txt ./notebooks/data/RNN/```
             *   ```wc ALL_1-vocab.txt  # 511438 1022864 6223250 ALL_1-vocab.txt```
          *   ```/usr/share/dict/linux.words``` for an alphabetical dictionary

### Next workshop venue : FOSSASIA - (2017-03-18 @16:55)  1hr

I gave a Deep Learning talk last year at FOSSASIA.  This was followed by more talks within the same subject at PyConSG and FifthElephant (India).

Since the last FOSSASIA, the Deep Learning Workshop repo (on mdda's GitHub) has been extended substantially.  
Depending on the time allotted, we'll be able to tackle 1 or 2 'cutting edge' topics in Deep Learning.  
Participants will be able to install the working examples on their own machines, and tweak and extend them for themselves.  

Like last year, the Virtual Box Appliances will be distributed on USB drives : The set-up has been proven to work well.  
Since this is hands-on, some familiarity with installing, running and playing with software will be assumed.  
Depending on demand, I can also do a quick intro about Deep Learning itself, 
though that would be pretty well-trodden ground that people who are interested would have seen several times before.

*   1hr <--- This is what they've asked for

### Restructuring REPO
  Individual projects should go into their own repos to increase discoverability
  eg:
    BubbleBreaker                                  << mostly DONE
    CNN for Voice Stamps                           << mostly DONE
    Transfer Learning with SVM
    Keras GoogLeNet (including slim-to-keras)
    Captioning (including AIAYN)
    ChooseGPU
  and then pull in these repos suitably for the main VM creation
  Also : 
    Add RPM proxy mechanism
    /or/ think about doing it via docker and a wrapper...
  
  Now : 
    Migrate off Theano fully
    Contemplate installing PyTorch
    Or, instead, making use of tf.eager

STDP essentially pushes neurons to predict the future,

There is no such thing as a fully connected layer in the brain, 
connectivity is usually sparse (though not random). 
This usually is related to the segregation of different channels of information.

This remains true for a while afterwards, since we rarely use our sensory facilities to view collections of random, unrelated photos.

The STDP rule states that if A fires and B fires after a short delay, 
the synapse will be potentiated (i.e. B will increase the 'weight' assigned to inputs from A in the future).
>
>The magnitude of the weight increase is inversely proportional to the delay between A firing and B firing. 
So, if A fires and then B fires ten seconds later, the weight change will be essentially zero. 
But if A fires and B fires ten milliseconds later, the weight update will be more substantial.
>
>The reverse also applies. 
If B fires first, then A, then the synapse will weaken, and the size of the change is again inversely proportional to the delay.
>
>ELI5 version: STDP is a rule that encourages neurons to 'pay more attention' to inputs that predict excitation. 
Suppose you usually only bring an umbrella if you have reasons to think it will rain (weather report, you see rain outside, etc.). 
Then you notice that if you see your neighbor carrying an umbrella, 
even though you haven't seen any rain in the forecast, 
but sure enough, a few minutes later you see an updated forecast (or it starts raining). 
This happens a few times, and you get the idea: Your neighbor seems to be getting this information (whether it is going to rain) 
before your current sources. 
So in the future, you pay more attention to what your neighbor is doing.

      I think when taking the brain as inspiration, the main question is which kinds of neural computations are necessary 
      and which are merely biological artifacts/spandrels. 
      
      Superficially, short-term plasticity strikes me as an artifact because it results from neurotransmitter depletion. 
      
      Spikes are necessary to avoid noise build-up, and depletion seems to be basically an artifact of this adaptation. 
      And even if depletion is evolved to be more pronounced and useful for computations such as gain-control 
      (down-regulating high-frequency inputs and up-regulating low-frequency input) and high- or low-band-filtering (which it appears to be), 
      it remains a question whether one would lose important computations if one leaves out such details. 
      
      I could image that each additional kind of computation will make a suitable learning rule more complicated 
      because each kind comes with its own set of hyper-parameters (e.g. gain, band specifications and kernel sizes), 
      each of which must probably be balanced in just the right way to avoid positive feedback-loops and catastrophic forgetting. 
      
      I could also imagine that several different priors expressed in the kernel sizes are necessary such that 
      different neurons can efficiently extract temporal information that is interesting in real-world data 
      (basically from the milliseconds to the seconds scale). 
      
      It generally seems like we need 
      (1) plenty of different kinds of computations, 
      (2) a connectome with a stochastic but a fairly simple connection scheme, 
      (3) a free energy minimizing learning rule where the energy is measured by sparse and delayed rewards and prediction errors. 
      
      Among those computations will likely be multiple kinds of non-linearities, 
      spatial and temporal clustering, modulation, normalization, lateral inhibition, 
      plenty of modulatory feedback connections. 
      
      The last step might be a massive hyper-parameter search by evolution of embodied agents in a resource-constrained sim. 
      That's what I would bet my money on.



###  More explicit description of comms

[–]deathofamorty 1 point 1 day ago 

How is it that neurons A and B know when each other fires? Is there a special type of synapse or something?

[–]Optrode 6 points 23 hours ago 

>Well, assuming that A synapses onto B but there is no reciprocal connection, A does not know when B fires. 
B, the post-synaptic neuron, knows A fired because it receives synaptic input from that synapses when A fires. 
Altering that synaptic weight is (in the most common cases) something that B does. 
A does not have to actively participate, beyond simply having fired at the appropriate time (which B detects).
>
>The exact mechanism for the synaptic potentiation is not clear...  
We know what some of the mechanisms in some cases are. 
There is a type of glutamate receptor, the NMDA receptor, that is well known for its role in long term synaptic potentiation (LTP). 
The NMDA receptor acts as a coincidence detector: 
it will only allow calcium ions into the postsynaptic neuron if a synaptic signal is received 
when the postsynaptic neuron is already depolarized to a positive voltage (i.e. activated).
>
>Mind you, that's extremely ELI5. 
There's a lot more to it, such as the fact that what actually matters is whether 
the DENDRITE (input structure of the neuron) is depolarized, not the whole cell, 
and those don't necessarily go hand in hand. 
Exactly how strongly the depolarization of the neuron's cell body depolarizes any particular dendrite branch will 
depend on the structure of the branch, and this can make it so that certain other synaptic inputs 
(a neuron has an average of 7000) may have a greater effect on whether synapses on a 
particular dendrite are in a state to be strengthened by LTP.
>
>Dendrites also have other cool properties, like how it's possible for a certain type of inhibitory input (Cl- channel mediated inhibition, as opposed to K+ channel mediated inhibition) to be capable of canceling out only certain excitatory inputs, but not others, as well as controlling how readily the neuron can be excited by repeated excitatory inputs (vs. requiring all the excitatory input to arrive at once).
>
>Which kind demonstrates another important difference between artificial neural networks and real neurons.. The "neurons" in an ANN are mostly linear, they just have a nonlinear activation function. Inputs are linearly summed. Real neurons do not linearly sun their inputs, the whole process of receiving input is nonlinear as fuck.



[–]timtom85 2 points 9 hours ago 

>I also checked out STDP after reading this and what caught my attention was the weakening of the weight if an input fires slightly after the neuron does. It seems very important to me because it can effectively get rid of spurious correlations, it can suppress feedback loops, and it can weed out unnecessary connections.




[–]CireNeikual 5 points 2 days ago 

What about TargetProp? It works without differentiable functions, it can be used with STDP/Hebbian learning (with appropriate discrete timesteps Hebbian and STDP can be equivalent).

I personally like revisting old methods and seeing how they fair with some new upgrades. Adaptive Resonance Theory, Self-Organizing Maps, or any other kind of vector quantizer. When in an appropriate architecture, they can do some interesting things. Interestingly, as soon as one abandons the need for differentiable functions and embraces sparsity, online/lifelong/incremental learning becomes much easier. This also leads to a performance boost, as one doesn't need many decorrelated replay samples in order to update. Further, with sparsity, sparse updates are possible, giving a further performance boost.

The human brain is quite sparse (it's the function of inhibitory neurons), so I feel like this is the right direction to take. Sparsity leads to low processing power use, something I feel this field desperately needs, with all the big projects taking fat GPU-filled server racks.

[–]nobackprop 1 point 1 day ago 

I'll repeat here what I wrote elsewhere in this thread.

There is only one viable solution to unsupervised learning, the one used by the brain. It is based on spike timing. The cortex tries to find order in sensory discrete signals or spikes. The only type of order that can be found in spikes is temporal order. Here is the clincher: spikes are either concurrent or sequential. I and others have been saying this for years. Here's a link, if you are interested:

Why Deep Learning Is a Hindrance to Progress Toward True AI

It's all about timing.

Train another network to guess future coefficients. So basically, still backprop at heart, but faster and more chaotic. Leap blindly downhill on gradient descent.

Early on, maybe keep the shitty random values, but change the connections.
