## Now MOVED

The Bubblebreaker notebook and supporting model code has 
been split off into a separate repo : 

*  https://github.com/mdda/rl-bubble-breaker

New developments will happen there, and (when it's next 
needed for the DL workshop package) I'll figure out 
how to pull it in as a submodule.
