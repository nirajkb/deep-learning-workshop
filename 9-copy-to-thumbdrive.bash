Deep-Learning-Workshop "Hands-on" Materials
-------------------------------------------

Please do each of the following steps :

1) Create a new folder on your laptop's hard drive

2) Copy the /presentation folder on the USB drive into your new folder

3) Copy the '.ova' file  on the USB drive into your new folder

4) If you *don't* have VirtualBox installed : 
    a) You should have read the workshop description more carefully; 
    b) You might be able to use an installation file from the /virtualbox-install/ folder; and
    c) Good luck...

5) Launch a browser on your copy of /presentation/index.html

6) Pass the key to someone else who needs it - or back to the speaker...
